# Q and A Forum
To access the forums that are available to Blackbaud Partners using the Infinity SDK and other technical solutions such as the {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}, go to the [Blackbaud Developer Network](http://www.bbdevnetwork.com/).

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} was created with open source technologies that are part of the public domain. While you can use it to create automated test suites for ***Blackbaud CRM***, it does not include any Blackbaud-maintained tools and is not actively supported by Blackbaud.</p>
